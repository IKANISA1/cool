---
1) Define target JSON schema for “TripIntent”.
2) Create an evaluation set of at least 30 phrases:
   - city->city, neighborhood->neighborhood, ambiguous, multilingual
3) Run parsing attempts and score:
   - correctness (from/to/time/seats/vehicle)
   - clarification quality
4) Summarize failures and propose prompt/tool fixes.
