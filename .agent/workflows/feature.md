description: Build a feature end-to-end with artifacts, tests, and walkthrough
---
1) Restate the feature in 5 bullets (scope + non-goals check).
2) Create/Update Implementation Plan artifact:
   - files to touch
   - API/DB changes
   - edge cases
   - verification approach
3) Create/Update Task List artifact with checkboxes.
4) Implement minimal code that satisfies scope.
5) Add/Update tests for tricky logic.
6) Verify locally (build + minimal manual flow).
7) Produce Walkthrough artifact:
   - what you ran
   - what you clicked
   - screenshots/recording references
