# Sub-Saharan Africa reality constraints (MUST design for)

Connectivity + devices
- Assume intermittent network, high latency, and budget phones.
- Any core flow must tolerate temporary offline and recover gracefully.

Trust + safety
- Abuse is normal: spam, harassment, scam attempts.
- Add rate limits, block/report, and privacy controls early.

Languages
- All user-facing copy must be short and easily localizable.
- Avoid idioms; keep nouns/verbs simple.

Location privacy
- Never expose precise location by default. Use approximate distance buckets.
