# UX rules (minimalist, world-class)

- Default experience: fast list-based discovery (drivers / passengers).
- Maps are optional, never required for core flow.
- Every screen must have a single primary action.
- Use bottom sheets for details; avoid deep navigation stacks.
- Haptics: only for key confirmations (request sent, request accepted, payment utility done).
- Motion: soft, short, never blocking; must run well on low-end Android.
- Empty states must teach: what to do next in 1–2 lines.
- Always provide “low-data mode” behavior (reduced images/animations).
