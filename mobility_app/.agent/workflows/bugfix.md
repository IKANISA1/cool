description: Debug and fix an issue with repro steps, minimal fix, and regression proof
---
1) Write “Observed vs Expected” + environment assumptions.
2) Create a repro plan (fastest deterministic reproduction).
3) Identify root cause (code pointers + reasoning).
4) Implement minimal fix.
5) Add regression test (or a verification script).
6) Verify and document in Walkthrough.
